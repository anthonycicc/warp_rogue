= Stat Tests =

The outcome of many game events is determined by character stat tests. A D100 is rolled and compared to the current value of the tested stat. If the result of the dice roll is lower than or equal to the stat value the test counts as passed, otherwise it counts as failed.

EXCEPTION: A dice roll between 1 and 5 automatically succeeds. 
EXCEPTION: A dice roll between 96 and 100 automatically fails.
