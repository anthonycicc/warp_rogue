A character's morale can be broken. If that happens he is no longer able to fight / tries to flee. There are many ways to break the morale of a character, but all of them are based on a Will Power test. If the character fails the test he becomes broken. The most common threat to a character's morale are injuries (i.e. pain). Everytime a character is wounded he must pass a Will Power test if his injurity value is higher than X percent of his Toughness value, where X is his current Will Power value.
