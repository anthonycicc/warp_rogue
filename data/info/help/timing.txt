Time is divided into rounds. 

Each character gets one action per round. 

The order in which the characters act depends on the Initiative values of the characters. The character with the highest Initiative acts first.

A character's Initiative value is usually equal to his Agility stat. However, if the character's party has a member who has the Battle tactics perk, he gets a +20 Initiative bonus.
