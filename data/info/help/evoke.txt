  The Psychic Test
  Range


In order to evoke a psychic power a character must past a psychic test.

= The Psychic Test =

X D10 are rolled, where X depends on the evoker's psychic perk level. A character with Psychic I rolls one D10, a character with Psychic II rolls two D10, etc. The result is called evocation roll result.

The evoction roll result is compared to the psychic test value. The psychic test value is equal to the evocation value of the power the character attempts to evoke + modifiers (see below). If the evocation roll result is equal to or greater than the psychic test value the evocation succeeds, otherwise it fails.

EXCEPTION: If all the dice of the character's evocation roll come up 1, the evocation fails automatically.

= Range =

It is harder to project psychic force across a longer distance than projecting it at something nearby. This is represented by the following range-based modifiers which are applied to the psychic test value:

Range            |  Modifier  |  
-----------------|------------|
Close Combat     |   +3       |  
Short Range      |   0        | 
Medium Range     |   +1       |   
Long Range       |   +2       |  
Very Long Range  |   +4       |

Evoking psychic powers while being involved in close combat is also difficult, this is represented by the penalty for close combat evocations.
