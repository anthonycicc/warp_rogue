NOTE: The AI will do the following things automatically if there is nothing more important to do: unjamming its weapon, reloading its weapon, and recovering (in that order).

Plan A! (default behaviour)

Follow the player controlled character if there are no noticed enemies. As soon as you notice enemies, attack the nearest enemy.

Get ready!

Stay at your current position, and wait for the enemy to show up. As soon as the enemy shows up, change tactic to "Plan A!".

Stay close!

Stay close to the player controlled character. Attack noticed enemies if it is possible without moving away from the player controlled character.

Hold position!

Stay at your current position. Attack noticed enemies if it is possible without moving away from your current position.
