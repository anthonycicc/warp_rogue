Warp Rogue features a simplistic and highly specialized implementation of macros. You can use them to automatize repetitive keypress sequences. For example a possible attack sequence would be 'a' (attack) ,'n' (nearest enemy), '1' (semi-automatic), '3' (3 shots). And pressing "an13" every time you want to shoot will get tedious pretty fast. It is much more comfortable to just define a macro. For example you can link the F1 key (the F1 - F12 keys are reserved for macros) to the sequence "an13" and instead of pressing 4 keys you will only have to press one key in future. Warp Rogue has a useful special feature related to macros: any failed command will stop a macro sequence. For example if your gun has no ammo left the "an13" macro would abort right after "a". This feature prevents that you waste actions or miss important messages while using macros.
