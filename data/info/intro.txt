= Background =

Proelium, a planet devastated by war and aggressive exploitation. All that remains is a barren, toxic wasteland. Most of the population lives in Hive Cruor, the only larger city left. Proelium belongs to the Imperium, a gigantic empire spanning thousands of planets. Located in a remote area of the galaxy and weakened by economic ruin Proelium is a perfect target for the enemies of the Imperium. Proelium is being attacked by both alien invaders and the forces of Chaos. When Governour Bismarck, the current governour of Proelium, called for help the Imperial authorities replied that they had no resources to spare because of the Great Swarm War. The alien race only known as "The  Swarm" has invaded the eastern edge of the galaxy, many Imperial worlds have already fallen, and the Swarm is advancing rapidly. At the moment, the Imperium is gathering all its forces in a desperate attempt to stop the Swarm before it reaches the Imperial heartland.
