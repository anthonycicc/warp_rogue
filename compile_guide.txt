Building

All ports use make files and the process of building is similar on all platforms:

- CD to the /src directory

- execute: [make tool] -f[make file] release
  example: mingw32-make -fwindows.mak release

- an executable called "wrogue" should be generated in the main program directory
  

General Instructions for Unsupported Compilers
 
- add the following directories to the include path of your compiler:
  /src, /src/lib

  Make sure that these directories are searched by your compiler
  BEFORE all other directories! This is necessary because otherwise
  your compiler might include wrong header files!

- add all .c files in the /src directory and its subdirectories, except
  the files in /src/platform to your project/make file

- add the platform .c file for your target platform to your project/make file 
  example: /src/platform/windows/platform_win.c  

- add the SDL platform .c file (/src/platform/sdl/platform_sdl.c) to your 
  project/make file
